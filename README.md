# Space Combat Arena: Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) Prototype

## Overview
Welcome to the interactive demo of my Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) system.
This repository holds the build of the space combat arena game, crafted as part of my research project that explores the effectiveness and impact of DDA systems in video games.

## Game Description
Engage in a thrilling space combat experience where challenges dynamically adjust to match your gameplay skill. This game incorporates a sophisticated DDA system that tailors difficulty in real-time based on performance metrics (Player-centric difficutly adjustment - PCDA), aiming to provide a balanced challenge that adapts to both novices and experts alike.

## Objective
The primary goal of this prototype is to demonstrate the DDA system's ability to create a personalized gaming experience. It adjusts the game's difficulty based on real-time analysis of player performance, aiming to maintain engagement and satisfaction.

## How to Play
1. **Download the Build:** Access the [Releases](https://github.com/BeHaVeZ/DDA_GW2024-25/releases) section to download the latest version of the game.
2. **Install the Game:** Extract the SpaceCombatPrototype folder.
3. **Start the game** Run the DDA-Gradwork.exe and the game should boot up.
4. **Experience Dynamic Difficulty:** Play through the game and observe how the difficulty changes in response to your gameplay style. Experiment with different tactics to see how the system adjusts.
5. **See the changes:** After 7 sessions the game will close and inside the _../DDA-Gradwork_Data/_ folder you will find a Statistics folder. Inside that folder you will see the _session_stats.json_ file that holds the changes of each session for you to see.

## Feedback
